# Lab 3 - Connect the Dots Revisited

## Benchmarking

## Time Analysis

* `removeDots()` when using **ArrayList** with **n-1** desired dots
   * $O(n^2)$: `removeDots()` is a for loop nested in a while loop.
* `removeDots()` when using **ArrayList** with **3** desired dots
   * $O(n)$: Some Reasoning
* `removeDots()` when using **LinkedList** with **nâˆ’1** desired dots
   * $O(n)$: Some Reasoning
* `removeDots()` when using **LinkedList** with **3** desired dots
   * $O(n)$: Some Reasoning
